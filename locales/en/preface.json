  "body": "This website was made based on the idea what if there is a Wikipedia specialized on language with the interactivity of Google Earth. There are already services like Duolingo and Memrise that invites users to learn a new language through quizzes. This website aims to do the same, not necessarily through games and quizzes, but more so by providing information useful for comprehension in an engaging format. Language is a big part of culture. Hopefully, this enables people, young and old, to be more in touch of what our ancestors have left us with."
