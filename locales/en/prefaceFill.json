  "preface": "This website was made based on the idea what if there is a Wikipedia focusing on language with the interactivity of Google Earth. There are already services like Duolingo and Memrise that engages users to learn a new language through quizzes. This website aims to spread interests on language-learning, not necessarily through games and quizzes, but rather by providing information useful for comprehension in an engaging format."
