  "prefaceA": "I have had an idea for a website like Wikipedia mixed with Google Earth years now, and had the opportunity to use it for my graduation project. Having nobody around sharing similar interests as me, though, I had to do things by myself, from design to implementation.",
  "prefaceB": "I decided to only work with a single field of study (language) and focus more on creating a richer user-experience compared to said Wikipedia. You have to start somewhere. Now, a website for language-learning is nothing new. (e.g. Duolingo and Memrise.) The problem is, however, they do not showcase the characteristics or nature a language has, which I believe is crucial for language learners. This is my attempt to solve that using only limited knowledge and resources. I hope this is useful."
